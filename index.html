Hello Lokinet. Glad you've made it!

You are viewing the setup page of SNApp-PI-HOST available free here: <a href="https://github.com/necro-nemesis/SNApp-Pi-Host">Github</a>

Your webpages will replace the current index.html file in the /home/$USER/snapp directory.
Simply stop the snapp server through openning the hidden detached screen with "screen -r snapp" then "Ctrl C".
You can then add your webpage files to the snapp directory. To restart the SNapp server navigate to the snapp folder and
enter "sudo ./snapp.sh" and the server will restart again in a hidden detached screen named "snapp". Once you're
done you may close the terminal and your SNApp will continue to be served in the background.

If you find this helpful please donate.
